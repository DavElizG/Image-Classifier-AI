# Image Classifier AI - Backend

## Overview
This backend application serves as the core of the Image Classifier AI project. It is responsible for handling image uploads, processing the images, and returning classification results based on a predefined set of categories. The backend is built using Flask (or FastAPI) and integrates with a machine learning model for image classification.

## Features
- Upload images for classification.
- Automatically classify images into predefined categories.
- Return classification results with confidence levels.
- Validate and process images before classification.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask or FastAPI
- TensorFlow (or another machine learning library)
- Image processing libraries (e.g., Pillow)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd image-classifier-ai/backend
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application
1. Start the server:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

2. The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000` (or the specified port).

## API Endpoints
- **POST /api/classify**: Upload an image for classification.
  - Request: Image file
  - Response: Predicted category and confidence level
